      Welcome to my little corner of the internet.
      <br />
      I&apos;m a rising junior at Purdue University with a passion for GenAI and
      Security, and a Data Analyst Intern at Chubb Insurance.
      <br />
      In my free time, I love playing flag football, following the NFL (go
      Niners!), and learning about the latest innovations in technology.
      <br />
      <br />
      Feel free to stick around and explore for a little while longer.
