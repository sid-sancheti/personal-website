            Greetings traveller 🚀. Its a pleasure to make your aquantaince in my little corner of the internet.
            A bit about me... I am a student at Purdue University studying Computer Science with a focus in Security.
            I am a lover of all things tech and am always looking for the next big thing. I dive into everything that
            piques my interest in the moment, which is currently Graphics and Security.

            Feel free to explore a little bit longer 😁...
        </p>
