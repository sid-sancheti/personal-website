# Sid's Personal Website

My personal blog is built with React and Next.js using Typescript.

To build my website yourself, ensure you have node installed.

```{bash}
node --version
npm --version
```

Both of these commands should give a output.

Clone the project into your preferred directory, cd into it, and run:

```{bash}
npm install
npm run dev
```
